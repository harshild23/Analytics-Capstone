# Analytics-Capstone "Heart Disease Prediction" Project
## Project Goal
Heart failure is a critical health issue affecting millions worldwide. Early detection can save lives by enabling timely treatment, but it is challenging because many factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate, play a role.
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the risk of heart failure based on patient data. By analyzing key health factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early. Early detection can lead to better treatments and potentially save lives.

## Features of the Heart Failure Prediction Project

### Predicting Heart Failure Risk

The project uses patient health data to predict if someone is at risk of heart failure.
This helps doctors identify high-risk patients early for timely treatment.

### Understanding the Data

The project shows trends and patterns in the data using easy-to-understand graphs and charts.
This helps users see how different health factors (like cholesterol or age) relate to heart failure.

### Simple Visual Reports

The project creates clear visual summaries of the results, making it easy for doctors and other users to understand.
No technical expertise is needed to interpret the findings.

### Key Factor Analysis

The project identifies the most important health factors that contribute to heart failure risk.
This gives doctors insights into what matters most for patient care.

### Testing Different Models

Several machine learning models (like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees) are tested to find the most accurate one.
The best model is then used to make predictions.

### Checking Model Accuracy

The project measures how well the model works using accuracy, precision, and recall.
This ensures that predictions are reliable.

### Report Writing

write a scientific report about the project.

## Target

The target of this project is to develop a predictive model for heart failure risk that achieves at least 80% accuracy on the validation dataset, identifies key factors influencing heart failure with clear visualizations, and generalizes well to new patient data. Additionally, the project aims to produce a comprehensive report summarizing findings, insights, and practical recommendations for healthcare providers to enhance diagnosis and treatment.
